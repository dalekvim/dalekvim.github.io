# Hello there!
Hello, my name is Vimal Vinod :wave:. Welcome to my website.

Who knew creating a website would be so tough though. I'm glad I'm not letting myself be bogged
down by things like styling when I can't even think of good content.
Maybe that wasn't a good thing to say to a potential employer :grimacing:.

## About Me
I'm an undergraduate at the **University of Warwick** :school: which is one of the best universities
in the UK when it comes to mathematics.

I've been using React for almost 5 years now. Unfortunately, most of the applications that I made with React
were full stack and had a GraphQL API as a backend. It's unfortunate because the API were served using Heroku
which no longer has a free tier.
