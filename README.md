# Welcome to my website!

My name is Vimal Vinod. My family is originally from south India, but I grew up in Leicester, England. As of September 2024, I'll start my third year as a mathematics undergraduate at the University of Warwick.

In my free time, I enjoy watching anime and cycling to new places with my little brother. I also like to write stories and program.

In the future, I'm currently tied between becoming a mathematics teacher or a software developer. Both jobs have their advantages and disadvantages. Whatever job I get, I would like to travel around the world one day.
