# About Me

I'm an undergraduate at the **University of Warwick**, studying mathematics. Warwick is the one of the top three universites in the UK when it comes to maths. I guess that's a round about way of saying that it's the third best, but it's a nice place. Very diverse and inclusive.

As one of my extra modules, I take Japanese because I really like Anime and Manga. If you are working on a project related to any of those, I would like to know. Also, check out my website of anime/manga reviews: [Idea of a Story](https://theideaofastory.blogspot.com/).
