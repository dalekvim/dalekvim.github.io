# My Experience

I've been using React for almost 5 years now. Unfortunately, almost all the applications that I made with React were full stack and had a GraphQL API as a backend. It's unfortunate because the API were served using Heroku which no longer has a free tier.

Recently, though, I've been looking into Flutter. Mostly, because I want to make an android app. I tried one with React Native and Expo, but it didn't work. By which I mean, I was able to create an app that worked on Expo Go during development, but when I submitted it in for alpha testing, I found that it didn't work on most android devices. It didn't even display any error, just crashed.

Flutter is very different from react native, but they have a lot of good documentation and videos that I want to check out. Like widget of the week for example. I also had a nice time following along with the create your first flutter app tutorial. You can see mine [here](https://github.com/dalekvim/my_first_flutter_app).
